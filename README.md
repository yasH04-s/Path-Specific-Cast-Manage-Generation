# Path-Specific-Cast-Manage-Generation
Advanced computational navigation project exploring graph-based path planning through occupancy grid mapping and ArUco marker-assisted object detection.

This project explores advanced techniques in autonomous robot navigation, including:

**Real-time Environment Perception:** Using ray casting and ArUco marker detection to build an occupancy grid map of the environment.

**Intelligent Path Planning:** Generating navigation paths based on the occupancy grid and a graph-based pathfinding algorithm.

**Computational Robotics Approach:** Integrating computer vision, occupancy mapping, and graph-based planning for dynamic robot movement.

The key components of the project are:

**ArUco Detector:** Identifies and locates ArUco markers in the simulated environment to aid in object detection.

**Cast Mapping:** Generates a cast-mapped representation of the environment using ray casting techniques.

**Occupancy Grid:** Maintains a probabilistic grid-based map of the environment's occupancy status.

**Path Planner:** Implements graph-based pathfinding algorithms to generate optimal navigation routes.

The project demonstrates how these components can be integrated to enable an autonomous robot to navigate through a dynamic environment, avoiding obstacles and reaching a designated target location.
